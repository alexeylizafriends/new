            "And I guess you will have to live with that",
            "We both have to accept one thing",
            "For me it is that you want to move on from me",
            "And for you it is that I won't leave you alone until I moved on myself",

            "Yea, we would still be together if I didnt do what I did and I know all of this is my fault",
            "Even now that you say that I dont control your life anymore,",
            "And that I mean nothing to you anymore, Which I dont know what you meant by that,",
            "Either it is that You dont Love me anymore and you Just want me gone",
            "Or it's that our relationship means nothing to you anymore",
            "I don't know if the things you said to me were because you just wanted me to block you",
            "And to hate you, but if you really mean that you allow other guys to follow you because why not then",

            "I'm sorry liza",
            "I regret Literally every single thing I've done since our breakup",
            "I should have just left you alone and not bother you and let you miss me",
            "And let you alone and no pressure at all instead of all of this",
            "And the reason I keep doing it is because now I know, it has gotten to a point where",
            "It is just annoying for you and if I don't text you anymore then you won't miss me",
            "And you will just continue to move on with your life and thats why",
            "I am trying to convince you to become my friend",
            "I know, I'm such a pussy for this",
            "I've seen tiktoks, even reposted, that I would never become friends with my ex",
            "But I cannot help myself",
            "I can't stand it not being in touch with you",
            "And its been 2 whole months, and You said no to me probably 1000 times",
            "And now i've gotten to a point where I want to move on myself",
            "But not stop being in touch with you",
            "Yesterday, I promised to leave you alone and I failed to do that",

            "I know I said it before, but I always forgot that I want that because of our flirting convos",
            "And Because of that I want to set up a few rules",
            "So we for real just stay friends and nothing else, and we don't get distracted again",
            "Because if we get distracted again, you will flirt with me and then you'll regret it, and be drier",
            "And then I will be mad again and spam you and then you will rage again and block me",
            "And I will keep making something to convince you to be friends again and then the whole thing will repeat",
            "So, I've come up with rules. Strict rules. That We will follow so we both can move on and stay friends",
            "Because, I cannot, and I refuse to stay blocked by you",
            "So until I have moved on I will not stop bothering you and I wont stop do you understand?",
            "Here are the rules:",
            "...",
            "Okay good, You read the rules",
            "Now I need your agreement.",
            "Click next to Proceed, btw, there will be a next button, dont press it if you see it because",
            "This code is complicated with the typing effect that I got confused and I can't read the code anymore ðŸ˜‚",
            "So just don't press it when you see it and just Press yes or no",
            "Okay, Proceed silly.",
            "....",
            "Thank you",
            "You now agreed to be friends with me, having those strict rules to ensure that we stay friends, and nothing more",
            "Just so there is no confusion:",
            "I love you, but it is clear that we will never be in a relationship due to what happened",
            "And like I said, We both need to accept one thing,",
            "For you it is that I won't leave you alone until I move on",
            "And for me it is that our love wont get a second chance and we HAVE to move on",
